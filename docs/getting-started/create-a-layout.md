title: Create a layout
description: Add some HTML code to the content
order: 2

The HTML code generated by the Markdown file in the
[the previous step](your-first-page.md) is very basic. If you open the
`_site/index.html` file, you will see something like this:

```html
<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
<p>
  This is my first page using <strong>Lume,</strong> a static site generator for
  Deno.
</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>
```

Probably you're missing some basic HTML tags like `<html>`, `<head>` or
`<body>`. This is because Markdown isn't a format designed to build complete
HTML pages, but only the part containing the article or post. You need to use a
**layout** to create a complete web page.

## Create a layout

Create a new directory `_includes` and the file `layout.vto` inside it. The
`.vto` extension is for [Vento](https://vento.js.org/): a template engine
supported by default by Lume. Add the following code to the file:

<lume-code>

```html {Title="_includes/layout.vto}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My first page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {{ content }}
  </body>
</html>
```

</lume-code>

This layout has the `HTML` code needed to build the whole page. The
`{{ content }}` code is a placeholder used to insert the rendered Markdown code.

> [!note]
>
> Go to [Vento documentation](https://vento.js.org/) to know more about its
> syntax.

## Assign the layout to the page

Now let's configure the `index.md` page to use the layout. We have to create a
_front matter_: a block delimited by two triple-dashed lines containing
[YAML](https://yaml.org/) code. In this block, we define the variable `layout`
with the value `layout.vto` (the path to the layout file just created).

<lume-code>

```yml {title="index.md"}
---
layout: layout.vto
---
# Welcome to my website

This is my first page using **Lume,**
a static site generator for Deno.

I hope you enjoy it.
```

</lume-code>

Lume will compile the Markdown code and use the `layout.vto` file as the page
layout.

> [!note]
>
> The directory `_includes` is a special directory that Lume understands. You
> don't need to include it in the `layout` variable.
